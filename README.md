Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) with B2B tools for creators, communities, and small businesses

## ❗ The Problem

Social networking today is fragmented and overwhelming. Real connection is buried under algorithmic feeds, siloed communities, and passive scrolling. Discovery is accidental, not intentional. Live conversations and community activity are scattered across platforms like X, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit—with little searchability or context.

---

## 💡 The Solution

Fleen is a real-time social network built for presence, not just posts. It unifies live conversation, interest-driven discovery, and community participation in one seamless experience.

### Key Features:

- 🎙️ **Live Real-Time Streams**  
  Start or join interest-based conversations instantly or on a schedule—voice-first and deeply contextual.

- 🎧 **Pre-Call Vibes**  
  Let users set the tone for streams with Spotify or YouTube Music links—create atmosphere before conversation begins.

- 🔍 **Social Search Engine**  
  Search people, streams, polls, soft asks, businesses, opportunities, and ideas—all linked to Fleen’s real-time graph.

- 🧠 **Voice-Led Discovery**  
  Real people sharing ideas in real time. Think living conversations, not static content.

- 🌐 **Business & Community Pages**  
  Help local creators and communities get discovered with rich, searchable profiles linking external channels (Instagram, Reddit, etc.).

- 🤫 **Soft Asks (Anonymous & Real-Time)**  
  Users can ask anonymous questions or make requests—openly or discreetly. Others reply with empathy, experience, or links to real people or groups. Everything feels safe, searchable, and human.

- 🧳 **Job Discovery (Structured + Unstructured)**  
  Discover job openings from hidden places: tweets, Discords, Telegram channels, or even random DMs—plus official integrations with ATS platforms (like Lever, Workable, and Greenhouse). We surface what the algorithms can't.

The need for meaningful interaction is growing. Fleen fills the void by creating intentional, low-friction spaces for real-time conversations and shared curiosity. In an era of algorithm fatigue, people want human-first platforms—not passive content feeds.
